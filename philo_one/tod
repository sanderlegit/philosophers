make sure theyre printing their deaths within 10ms
	by haivng a thread that just checks if theyve died or not
		data should have all philos stored		<-- done

pthread_detatch after creating a thread

check the bounds of the arguments properly
	if (data->phil_count < 2 || data->phil_count > 200)
		return (true);
	if (data->time.die < 60 || data->time.eat < 60 || data->time.sleep < 60)
		return (true);
	if (data->min_eat && data->min_eat <= 0)
		return (true);

create a mutex lock for each fork instead of a char status array, or do both :)
	lock/unlock instead of setting 1 and 0 in the array
	individual message per fork
