pthread_create -> fork
d->has_died -> kill
pthread_join -> waitpid

psuesdo start-threads:

fork
if 0, i am child		done
	pthread_create to do the philo
	continue running onto manager
if non zero, i am parent, return was child pid	done
	store pid
	wait on all pids

manage-threads
	Same loop, but dont iterate over all children, end the process when death occurs



all processes must call the data_destructor
	add kill processes to killer
	set pids[i] to null on successful death/kill/wait

only parents process must call sem_destructor

rename start_threads -> start_processes


make sure test with max eat, because I think sem_wait(lstatus) locks
